1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1
*Ithe usest works on the textual format.
*There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
*It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
*It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2

*It works on the binary protocol.
*It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
*It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
*It uses HPACK for data compression.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
